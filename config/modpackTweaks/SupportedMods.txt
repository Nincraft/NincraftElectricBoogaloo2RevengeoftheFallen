**This is the file of supported mods and the info to go along with them**
**To add a mod to the file, type >ModCommandName, ModProperName<**
**The ModCommandName cannot have spaces, and will be used to call the mod's info command.**
**The ModProperName can have spaces - this is the "real name" of the mod, to be used in its guidebook title.**
**Example: >ThermalExpansion, Thermal Expansion 3<**
**After that, type any info about the mod. Mod information is naturally separated by the names of mods (inside ><)**
**To just specify a link, use <> (ex. <http://google.com>) and this will be put into the chat instead of a book**
**You CANNOT have a mod's documentation be both a book and a link, due to current limitations of the mod**
**That means, for mods where you want to link to a wiki, the link should be all that's there under it in this**
**documentation file.**
**The code will interpret "~~~" as a page break, and format the book accordingly**
**In addition, adding a "~" to the end of a line will add a line break**
**Two asterisks at the beginning of a line is a comment**
**Three asterisks and a number will skip that amount of lines following**


**Linked means there is a link to the wiki/website, but should still document it in-game if we have time**
**Incomplete means there is some documentation, but there could be more**
**If you alter this code please update this to-do. Or if you are working on one, put your name next to it. Thanks!**
**TO DO:**
**ADD MODS TO DO HERE**

Example:
>ModName<
This is some very useful info
and I am typing it on multiple lines 
to make this text file easier to read. 
These lines don't have line breaks between them 
in the book though because they don't end with "~".
~~~
Now I am on page 2~
Now I am one line down~
~
Now I am after a blank line
>ModName2<
<http://google.com>

**Begin line after asterisks**
